# DataMiningProject
This is a semester project of CS429-Data Mining at NUCES-ISB completed in Spring 2019

# Description
The assigned task was to recover images that had 50% of the values intentionally assigned null by our instructor. After recovering the images, we were to train a neural network for image classification.

# Tasks

1. Recover the Images
2. Recignize them

#Approach for recovering images

To recover the images interpolation was used since it gave better results when test data was given to the model. 
P.S. We tried compressed sensing too but interpolation gave better results 

# Data Set

Cifar-10 (80-20 split)
